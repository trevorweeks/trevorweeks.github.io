<h1> <center> <b> About Me <b></center> </h1>
<nav>
<P> I am currently a freshman at the University of Maine, Orono campus, majoring in accounting.</P>
<p> I was born in Nashua, New Hampshire, and lived in Londonderry for five years, then moved to Laconia, where I spent the remaining thirteen years of my life.</p>
<p> I am the middle of three brothers. My older brother is a senior at UMaine, age 21, and my little brother is a junior in high school, age 17. My parents are still together after thirty years of marriage, and we also have a six year old golden retriever, named Abby.</p>
